			  <span class="bodytextdark">About Me: </span><br><br>
<span class="resume">I live and breathe design. I can remember that from  a very young age I was mesmerized by fonts. I was given a book of different type faces, I could spend hours looking at them. But it was not until I was working for Lar Lubovitch dance company in NYC that someone noticed I had talent while working on one of their advertisements. Soon after, I applied to start my education at the School of Visual Arts and thus my love affair with design began. <br><br>

Although my education is based on graphic design in advertising, I always managed to take sculpting classes with a vision to combine sculpting with graphic design. 3-D graphics got me featured on MTV and shows at the Art Directors Club and Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.</span><br><br><br><br>

<span class="resume">Adobe Creative Suite <br>

Well Organized</span><br><br><br><br>


<span class="bodytextdark">Core Belief: </span><br><br>
<span class="bodytext">"The success of any project lies within the team, 
it does not matter what title you have, we are all an integral piece in the puzzle that brings the project together."</span><br><br>
